This test is to validate a design for creating a directory structure using the first 4 characters of a UUID. The first 2 characters (8bits) will represent the level 1 directory and the next 2 characters will represent level 2. If the characters are evenly spread, then there should be 2^8 = 256 directories at level 1 and 256 at level 2. If you consider storing a million files, there will be (1,000,000/256)/256 = 15.2 files in each directory
